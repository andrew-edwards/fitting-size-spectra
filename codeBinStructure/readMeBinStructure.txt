readMeBinStructure.txt - description of R code to reproduce results from second
manusript (on analysing binned data) and for analysing new such data.

Figure numbers are those from version ssmPart2-2018-04-13.pdf, which hopefully
shouldn't change before submission. So numbers may need changing here at some
point. I'm taking my original Sweave files and just extracting the necessary
R code to reproduce each figure (let me know if you would like the original
Sweave files, which automates some text also).


Figure 1 - Length-weight relationships for two species.
binFigs/binLW.r

Figure 2 - how binned body masses get assigned to logarithmic bins.
