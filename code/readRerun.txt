readRerun.txt - readMe file for Andy reruning all code to check .Rdata files 
 are from the final published versions. 
 **Other users can ignore this file, it mainly contains notes for me**.
 Andrew Edwards 20/5/16.

Some double checking is finding that the current .RData files are not
 exactly the same as those obtained when re-running the code line-by-line,
 I think just for fittingrep3.RData and MLEbin.
 To re-run all code again and redo all figures and check all numbers in 
 manuscript, am creating a new branch 're-run' and doing that there.
 Results should be identical if the random numbers are the same. 

Last year in seedTest/ I thought I figured it out, but now want to re-run
 everything. Think it's opposite to what I thought there.

What's currently saved in master/ branch and so is in the submitted manuscript
 and ssmRevBeforeRerun.pdf for x[1:8], the final set of 1,000 random numbers:

fitting3rep.RData  	   2.420 1.097 1.527
MLEbin.Rdata	    	   2.420 1.097 1.522
fitting3rep10000.Rdata	   1.097 1.522 2.997    so shifted by one

But re-running, I get:
fitting3rep.r		   1.097 1.522 2.99
fitting3repMLEbin.r        1.097 1.522 2.99

So not actually doing a fair comparison, because the same random numbers
 have not been used for all simulations (not so important when b etc. change).
 Thinking those may be the only real differences. Won't be relevant in practice
 (estimated b values may change very slightly), but worth fixing. 
 Expect those ones may be the only real differences. And it's not an R version
 issue.


[
 This may be only real change:
For example, re-running  multiple/fitting3rep.r 
 under version 3.2.3 gives 59% as the last number in the LCD row of Table 2,
 but the original simulations (version 3.1.0, and also a test with version
 3.2.2 on another computer) gives 60% - likely due to the random
 number generation. Though the difference is only due to 4 out of the 10,000
 simulations changing the estimate of b in the fifth signficant figure, and
 so not important in practice.
Aha - it's to do with the issue I had last year  - see seedTest/ and decide
 what to do. But not relevant in practice. Random numbers in saved fitting3rep.RData are shifted compared to re-running now. Seems to be opposite to what I'd
 said in seedTest/.

GOING THROUGH EACH piece of code listed below in git branch 're-run', and

1.Double click on the existing .Rdata file to open it in an R console..
1a. Open the .r code (Emacs) and check redo.simulation = TRUE.
2. Run the code (Emacs R console) and compare x[1:8] and other output with the existing results.
 It will save the new figures. Some code just plots figures
 and so will only change if an .RData file has changed. Most .RData files not
 committed.
3. git s  will tell if the .Rdata (if committed) and .eps files file have changed  (time will change, but if results are the same then the files won't change).
   So no need to do manually.
4. Check numbers I've flagged in the manuscript if things have changed, and
    change any in ssmRev.tex. 
5. If only changed TRUE to FALSE in .r then just undo that, check git s - not
    always doing since not committing .RData files except main one and xmax10000.
6. Close .RData file and Emacs window.
7. git com "<what changed...>" if anything changed.
8. Write 'Done' or 'Changed' below.
9. Do again for next piece of code.

10. After doing all of them, check each says done or changed, then re-latex the whole manuscript. Save as .pdf
 and compare with original: ssmRevBeforeRerun.pdf that I saved before making
 re-run branch.
11. Change anything in text if necessary, though will be doing that above.
11. For any main ones that changed do a seed check also if time, though
 had done those before (another new branch).


code/single/ - simulate a single data set and fit spectra using the eight methods
************

Done. fitting2.r - simulates a data set and then fits spectra using eight methods,
 producing Figures 1, 2 and A.1.

> x[1:8]
[1] 11.613220 15.658847  1.400273  5.869136  2.786321  2.077175  3.785753
[8]  1.155444


code/multiple/ - simulate 10,000 data sets and fit using the eight methods
**************

Changed. fitting3rep.r - results from 10,000 simulated data sets, to give the blue
 histograms in Figure 3 and the main results in Table 2. Also does the
 MLEfix method and plots Figure A.3.
DOES CHANGE (git s shows figures changed also). 
original     2.423351   1.097383   1.522616
re-run	     1.097383   1.522616   2.991980   so shifted.
Checking output for tables and changing LCD 60 to 59 in ssmRev.tex. It only 
 changed 4 out of the 10,000 LCD results across -2 in the fifth significant
 figure, but because of rounding this changed 60% being <-2 to 59%.

Changed. fitting3rep.RData - results from fitting3rep.r, to save having to re-run it.

Changed (re-ran after rerunning xmax10000, though they didn't change but 
 the ones here die). 
 fitting3repAdd.r - constructing Figure 3, combining simulation results from
 two sets of 10,000 simulated data sets (fitting3rep.r and 
 xmax10000/fitting3rep10000.r).

Changed. fitting3conf.r - Figure 4 plots of confidence intervals, and Figure A.4 for
 MLEfix method.

Changed. fitting3bmaxx.r - Figure A.2, showing relationship between MLE of b and MLE 
 of x_max for the 10,000 simulated data sets from Figure 3. And Figure A.5 for
 MLEfix method.

The following are the sensitivity analyses. Some are just modifications 
 of the above code, with new a value of a parameter (e.g. xmax)
 and renaming of anything that is saved (.RData and .eps files), and 
 changing of axes sizes where necessary (and maybe some other necessary tweaks).
 The above code may have been updated (written more clearly) after some of
 the following were done.

code/multiple/xmax10000/  - simulate 10,000 datasets with xmax = 10,000
************************

Done. fitting2-10000new.r - as for fitting2.r but for xmax=10,000, to produce 
 Figures A.6 and A.7.

Done. fitting3rep10000.r - as for fitting3rep.r but for xmax=10,000, to give
 gold histograms in Figure 3 and results in Table A.1.
x[1:8] after running:
Original  1.097479   1.523333   2.997359   1.174998 204.123944   6.720422   1.317265 3.385726
Re-run    2.426463   1.097479   1.523333   2.997359   1.174998 204.123944   6.720422 1.317265
So shifted, but OPPOSITE WAY ROUND to what I had before. I did run it in the same
 window after running fitting2-10000new.r. So even though it sets the seed back
 to 42 it gets different numbers? 
WEIRD:
Original:  MLE.rep[1:5]   -2.029340 -1.983046 -1.991417 -1.956672 -1.968601
Re-run:                   -2.029340 -1.985733 -1.987021 -1.957228 -1.968988
So first one is the same but the rest are not? LCD.rep has the same 'feature'.
And fitting3rep10000.eps and fitting3rep10000fix.eps have changed (.Rdata isn't
 committed).

Try running again but from a fresh Emacs ESS window, and get:
fresh x[1:8]:  1.097479   1.523333   2.997359   1.174998 204.123944   6.720422   1.317265
MLE.rep[1:5]: -2.029340 -1.983046 -1.991417 -1.956672 -1.968601
which agree with the ....  Original!!!
And git says the figures are the same as before!

So, my issue is that if I re-run the code from an open .r ESS window, even with 
 setting the seed it doesn't give the same results. So advise users that you
 need to open a fresh R window (at least using Emacs). But somehow the first
 1000-2000 random numbers are the same (since MLE.rep[1] same each time), 
 but not the rest. Strange. THAT explains the results above also, plus the
 confusion about the seed I had last year. 

So, to get consistent results I need to run everything in a fresh R console. 
 Simulations are getting 1000*10000 = 10^7 random numbers, but should still 
 be fine. The last one run is the fresh one, or which x[1:8] agree (close enough)
 to those for the re-run for multiple/fitting3rep.r. Close enough is correct
 because the numbers should be slighlty different due to xmax changing.

So these didn't change because fresh is the same as original. 

Should also create a minimum working example. But for now just carry on:

Done. fitting3conf10000.r - as for fitting3conf.r but for xmax=10,000, to give
 Figure A.8.

Done. fitting3bmaxx10000.r - Figure A.9 for the MLE and MLEfix methods, with 
 xmax = 10,000.

Done. compareXmax.r - comparing sample of 1,000 random PLB numbers
 for xmax=1,000 and xmax=10,000 with same seed, as documented in
 Section A.2.8 in the Appendix.


code/bMinus25/    b = -2.5
**************

Done. fitting2bMinus25.r - Figure A.10.

Changed. fitting3rep-bMinus25.r - Figure A.11 and Table A.2.

Changed. fitting3conf-bMinus25.r - Figure A.12


code/bMinus15/   b = -1.5
**************

Done. fitting2bMinus15.r - Figure A.13.

Done. fitting3rep-bMinus15.r - Figure A.14 and Table A.3.

Done. fitting3conf-bMinus15.r - Figure A.15


code/bMinus05/   b = -0.5
**************

Done. fitting2bMinus05.r - Figure A.16.

Done. fitting3rep-bMinus05.r - Figure A.17 and Table A.4.

Done. fitting3conf-bMinus05.r - Figure A.18


code/n10000/     n = 10000
************

Redoing main results with sample size (number of individual measurements) 
 increased to 10000.

Done. fitting2n10000.r - Figure A.19

Done. fitting3rep-n10000.r - Figure A.20 and Table A.5

Done. fitting3conf-n10000.r - Figure A.21


code/MLEbin/    MLEbin method for likelihood when the data are already binned
************

Changed. fitting3repMLEbin.r - same simulated data sets as in fitting3rep.r, but
 binning the data and then applying likelihood.

Changed. fitting3repMLEbin.Rdata - results from fitting3repMLEbin.r, since this file is 
 small.

Changed. fitting3confMLEbin.r  - confidence intervals for MLEbin method, to give Figure 5.


code/recommend/
***************

Done. recommend.r - Figure 6, recommended MLE calculations and resulting plots of 
 data and fitted size spectrum.

For seed results at the end of the Appendix, I have re-run in a new folder
  but then deleted the folder, since don't want to clutter up the directories 
  further.
